## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

It's my first time to code on Xcode. Fortunately, it's not so difficult to finish the prework by following the step-by-step instructions. However, it still took me a while to finish the prework on the very basic level. I desire to learn more in the future class and hope to add more useful function and attractive animations in the app.
